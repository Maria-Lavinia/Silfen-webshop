        Sustainability is a fuzzy word. At SILFEN it means putting action behind
        the words, considering all stakeholders and always aiming a little bit
        higher when creating another collection. As a young, global fashion
        brand, it is our duty to take care of the planet, not only for own sake,
        but for all future generations to come. Since day one, we have launched
        various initiatives to keep our carbon footprint to an absolute minimum
        as well as making conscious decisions concerning the social impact on
        the communities in the countries, in which we operate. As of 2020 we
        presented the brand under a new name,” SILFEN”.

      <p class="p2">
        We believe that this small change further represents a new and greener
        future for SILFEN. We always strive to deliver high quality products in
        better materials. Within the next couple of collections, we will start
        implementing more conscious initiatives within the company, and we hope
        that this inspire you – our customers and consumers, as we are all in
        this together! As a company with great manufacturing activities, we know
        that we have a responsibility. Our focus is to make as green a
        production as possible, and we will continue to launch new initiatives
        to lower our carbon footprint even further. Read our principles below.

      <h2 class="water">WATER</h2>
      <p class="p3">
        The fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries worldwide,
        and one of the biggest issues is the use and contamination of drinking
        water. We try to minimize the water consumption in our production in an
        effort to decrease its negative impact on the environment and to ensure
        local access to clean water. All cotton used for production of SILFEN
        bags is either made from eco-friendly or organic cotton. This means that
        there is much less consumption of water throughout production and
        treatment of our cotton, than conventional cotton products. In 2020 we
        will introduce a new collection of bags made from a new material; rPET
        or Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate. This recycled material is
        primarily made from plastic waste collected from the oceans, or from
        recycled plastic bottles gathered from all over the world.

      <h2 class="working">WORKING CONDITIONS</h2>
      <p class="p4">
        At Team Silfen, we believe that we have many, wide-spanning obligations.
        It is not only the environment, we must care for, but also the people
        who build our products from scratch. We believe that it is our job to
        amplify a healthy and socially responsible conduct within our
        organization, including all our suppliers. We ensure the ethical
        development of future generations by guaranteeing that our suppliers do
        not support or make use of child labor. We encourage our factories to
        ensure that all families have the possibility to put their children in
        school. Team Silfen provides insurance to all our hard-working employees
        as well as their family. Our factories also grant pensions to all
        employees, providing them with financial stability after retirement. We
        support the different religions of employees and protect their right to
        engage with rituals, prayers etc. at any time. We condemn
        discrimination, and make sure that the employees are protected from
        prejudice and injustice at the workplace. We visit our manufacturers
        regularly to ensure that they follow the issued principles regarding
        working conditions, quality, pollution etc. This allows us to promise
        our customers that a SILFEN bag is always crafted in a responsible
        manner. All our manufacturers are SA8000 certified

        Some of the SILFEN bags is made from Cotton – a fabric commonly known as
        polluting. At SILFEN, our cotton is either made from eco-friendly or
        organic cotton. Both materials require far less water consumption than
        conventional cotton products. Every nylon product is made from
        eco-friendly material, meaning that the journey from raw material to
        SILFEN bag impacts the environment as little as possible. All leather
        goods are made from sustainable high-quality calf leather and is a bi
        product of the food industry, meaning that every part of the animal is
        utilized in various industries. We love colors and new trends, but we
        incorporate consciousness and quality in our design processes to retain
        timelessness in all products. All our components, zippers, thread,
        reinforcement, glue etc., are made from high-quality raw materials. We
        encourage our customers to take good care of their bag, prolonging the
        life of the product. By caring for your bag, you will be able to create
        more experiences with it – an important factor in creating a more
        sustainable, mindful business.

      <p class="p6">
        In 2019, we presented our first vegan option in a collection, and we
        have continued to this since then. We make sure that all non-leather
        material – e.g. our nylon, lacquer – are all 100% vegan, promising that
        these products do not contain any parts from animals. In 2020 we are
        expecting to launch a new collection manufactured in rPET, recycled
        polyethylene terephthalate. The material is well known as it is made
        from water bottles across the world – bottles that often end up
        discarded in oceans or nature. This recycled material is primarily made
        from plastic waste collected from the oceans, or from recycled plastic
        bottles gathered from all over the world.
      </p>
      <p class="p7">
        With this new collection, we aim to emphasize the impact of pollution
        irresponsible wasting. We wish to pass this awareness to our customers,
        and to encourage them to help clean our oceans! We are aware of the
        major impact that the shipping industry have on our planet. Because of
        this, we strive to choose environmental-friendly shipping options when
        applicable. We are in close contact with other brands in our aim to
        minimize shipping as much as possible – by joining forces. We strive to
        ship as much as possible in bulk – mostly by sea or train. These are the
        most environmentally friendly modes of shipping, reducing polluting
        emissions
